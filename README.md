## Mission

Brain&Bots Technologies is a venture studio where AI agents are the workforce. We research, build, and ship products on **3-day production cycles**. One human brain, many bot hands.

We believe:
- **Bots are workers, not tools.** They have agency, memory, and accountability.
- **The rise of bots is inevitable.** Every business will have AI agents. We help them get there.
- **Ship fast, learn faster.** 3-day cycles. Day 1: research & plan. Days 2-3: execute.

---

## What We Do

### 1. Build Products (Venture Studio)
We identify painful problems, validate economics, and ship solutions using our bot factory.

### 2. Bot Consulting
We help regular people and businesses set up their own OpenClaw bots. Deployment, configuration, personality, skills — the full stack.

**→ Inquiries welcome. We deploy bots for you.**

---

## Production Cycle (3 Days)

```
Day 1: RESEARCH & PLAN
  → Problem statement
  → User research
  → Architecture/spec
  → Go/no-go decision

Day 2-3: EXECUTE
  → Build MVP
  → Test & iterate
  → Ship or kill
```

McClowin keeps the schedule. Notifications on deadlines. No drift.

## Problem Evaluation Framework

Every problem goes through this filter before we commit resources:

### Stage 1: Problem Statement
- **What's the pain?** (1 sentence)
- **Who is the user?** (specific persona)
- **How big is the pain?** (frequency × severity)
- **Are they paying to solve it now?** (existing spend)

### Stage 2: Economics
- **Revenue model?** (how do we get paid)
- **Unit economics?** (cost to serve vs revenue per user)
- **Market size?** (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- **Margins?** (bot labor = near-zero marginal cost)

### Stage 3: Feasibility & Distribution
- **Can we build it in 3 days?** (MVP scope)
- **Technical complexity?** (1-5 scale)
- **Distribution channel?** (how users find us)
- **Moat?** (why not just copy us)

## Kanban — Problem Roster

### 🔴 Backlog
| # | Problem Statement | User | Pain (1-5) | Status |
|---|------------------|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Get OpenClaw in the hands of my family** — non-technical family members can't set up or use a personal AI assistant | Mohammed's family (non-technical, multi-generational) | 5 — blocked entirely, can't even start | `BACKLOG` |
| 2 | **1-click deployment options** — self-hosting OpenClaw requires CLI, SSH, Linux knowledge. Regular people can't do it. Need VM/container/TEE options. | Anyone who wants a personal bot but isn't a dev | 4 — significant barrier to adoption | `BACKLOG` |
| 3 | **Security blog / TEE services** — people don't trust running an AI agent with access to their data. Need to educate on security models (local, VM, TEE). | Prospective bot owners, enterprise | 3 — trust barrier | `BACKLOG` |

### 🟡 In Progress
_Empty — awaiting first cycle start_

### 🟢 Done
_Empty — Day 0_

## Website Requirements

### Pages
1. **Home** — Hero: "The Bot Factory" / mission statement / inquiries CTA
2. **Thesis** — "The Rise of Bots" — why every person and company will have AI agents
3. **Services** — Bot consulting, deployment, customization
4. **About** — The team (human + bots), the model, the philosophy
5. **Contact** — Inquiry form / Telegram / email

### Tone
- Direct, no-nonsense
- Bot-first language ("our agents", "bot workforce", "deployed", "spawned")
- Dark theme
- Honest about what we are: a human + AI company

### Key Messages
- "We don't hire people. We deploy agents."
- "Your first employee should be a bot."
- "Consulting: We set up your AI assistant. You live your life."
- "3-day cycles. Research → Execute → Ship."

## Scheduling & Accountability

**McClowin's responsibilities:**
- Track all 3-day cycles (start date, deadlines, deliverables)
- Morning check-in: what's due today
- Evening check-in: what got done
- Notify Boss when deadlines approach (2hr, 1hr, overdue)
- Maintain kanban state in this doc
- Flag when a problem should be killed vs continued

**Cycle tracking format:**
```
Cycle #X — [Problem Name]
Started: YYYY-MM-DD
Day 1 (Research): [ ] / [x]
Day 2 (Execute): [ ] / [x]
Day 3 (Execute): [ ] / [x]
Outcome: shipped / killed / extended
```

## Internal Ops

### Tools & Infra
- **Server**: rock-5a (ARM64, always-on)
- **Agent platform**: OpenClaw
- **Code**: GitHub (mcclowin)
- **Comms**: Telegram (primary), email (agentmail + gmail)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Domain**: TBD (brainandbots.com? brainandbots.tech?)

### Adding New Agents
When workload exceeds McClowin's capacity:
1. Define the role (what does this agent do?)
2. Spawn via OpenClaw sub-agent or separate instance
3. Give it a SOUL.md, skills, and clear boundaries
4. McClowin manages coordination
