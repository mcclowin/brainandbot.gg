> The Rise of the Bots

- Every person will have a personal AI agent
- Every business will deploy AI workers alongside humans
- Bots are workers, not tools — they have agency, memory, and accountability
- The companies that figure out human-bot collaboration first will win
- We build with bots, not just for them
